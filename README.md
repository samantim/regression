This project is a comprehensive approach to regression problems. The program is designed in a way that applies to any dataset for regression.
The only modification needed is setting "target_col" and "unnecessary_cols" variables based on your dataset columns.
The program applies five regression models to your dataset and returns the evaluations and comparisons after optimization.
Place your CSV dataset in the input folder and change its name in the main function. Then, you can have all the results in the output folder after running the code.
The pdf file in the report folder contains a complete report based on an example dataset.
